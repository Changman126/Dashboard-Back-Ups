{"title": "Data Science  Specialization", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science", "text": ["In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. The course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. There are two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge. The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio.", "In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment and describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis will provide working examples.", "Before you can work with data you have to get some. This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover obtaining data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from colleagues in various formats. It will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data \u201ctidy\u201d. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.", "This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.", "This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.", "Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, \u2026) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.", "Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions.  Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist\u2019s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.", "One of the most common tasks performed by data scientists and data analysts are prediction and machine learning. This course will cover the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications. The course will provide basic grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets, overfitting, and error rates. The course will also introduce a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course will cover the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.", "A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.", "The capstone project class will allow students to create a usable/public data product that can be used to show your skills to potential employers. Projects will be drawn from real-world problems and will be conducted with industry, government, and academic partners.", "More questions? Visit the ", ".", "Ask the right questions, manipulate data sets, and create visualizations to communicate results.\n\nThis Specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final Capstone Project, you\u2019ll apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material."]},

Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time.

Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now.

Words and pictures\u2014the building blocks of graphic design\u2014are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the digital world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture.\n\nThrough visual examples, this course will teach you the fundamental principles of graphic design: imagemaking, typography, composition, working with color and shape... foundational skills that are common in all areas of graphic design practice. I don't just want you to watch a video of someone talking about design, I want you to MAKE design! If you want to be a designer you have to be a maker, a communicator, so this course will offer you lots of opportunities to get your hands dirty with exercises and with more practical projects.\n\nAt the end of this course you will have learned how to explore and investigate visual representation through a range of image-making techniques; have understand basic principles of working with shape, color and pattern; been exposed to the language and skills of typography; and understand and have applied the principles of composition and visual contrast. If you complete the course, along with its optional (but highly recommended) briefs, you will have a core set of graphic design skills that you can apply to your own projects, or to more deeply investigate a specialized area of graphic design.\n\nTo succeed in this course you will need access to a computer. You can complete this course without one but it will be tougher. Access to, and a beginner's level knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite programs, such as Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign will help you, especially if you want to complete the optional briefs.", "Typography is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control its meaning. It\u2019s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology\u2014but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.\n\nIn this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We\u2019ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We\u2019ll peek into the \u2028rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We\u2019ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we\u2019ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. \n\nInformative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating \u2028in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.\n\nPlease note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other \u2028page layout software will be assumed.

We'll create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or to try out a media. The first two weeks are experimental and exploratory; we won\u2019t be concerned with meaning or communication (although, to be honest, every image does exist in a context, and therefore communicates\u2014or can convey\u2014meaning, connotation, associations, and expressiveness). \n\nIn the second two weeks, we\u2019ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. Everyone has a natural, intuitive way of putting things together. We\u2019ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together, composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image\u2019s connotations, meanings and associations generated through elements of composition and \u201cvisual contrasts.\u201d through style, juxtaposition, closure and figures of speech. \n\nUltimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.", "This condensed survey course focuses on four key periods or themes from the history of design.

No previous experience is required.", "This course is the culmination of the Graphic Design Specialization and gives you an opportunity to tie together your knowledge and skills into a single project: a brand development guide for a company you will invent.\n\nThis course takes you through the entire design process, from ideation to creation to presentation. Through the guide, you will be creating and giving a visual identity to an imaginary start-up company, and applying that visual identity to a number of forms. You will also develop a logotype and accompanying graphic palette to visually represent your company, as well as apply that design to a number of different applications to see it at work.", "More questions?

The sequence is completed by a capstone project that applies the skills of each course and peer feedback in a finished branding project suitable for a professional portfolio.\n\nThe goal of this specialization is to equip learners with a set of transferable formal and conceptual tools for \u201cmaking and communicating\u201d in the field of graphic design.

The model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the foreign exchange market.

The model provides insights about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them.

We will then spend some time on developing an understanding of alternative decision criteria (NPV, IRR, Profitability, etc.) that are commonly used in the real world.  We will wrap up the course with an exposure to the determination of cash flows using accounting principles. The main focus in this building block will be on individual/personal decisions because of two reasons: (a) we learn when we see value to us as individuals and (b) the beauty of finance is that the building blocks of finance are applicable to any decision, personal or corporate. The course will last six weeks with time included for assimilation and two final exams.\n\nThis course is the first in a sequence of four courses, followed by a Capstone Project, that comprise a Specialization on Valuation & Investing.", "This second course in the specialization will last six weeks and will focus on the second main building block of financial analysis and valuation: risk. The notion of risk and statistics are intimately related and we will spend a fair amount of time on the development of some statistical concepts and tools, namely distribution theory and regression analysis. This time will be well spent because these concepts and tools are also commonly used in many applications in the real world. The foundational idea of diversification will then be used to develop a framework for evaluating risk and establishing a relationship between risk and return. Apart from developing a keen appreciation of risk for making thoughtful decisions in an institutional context, this course will contain a lot of material and examples that will enable the learner to make smart personal investing decisions.

Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism \u2013 rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based \u2013 the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price \u201crations\u201d the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies.

We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations.\n\u2022\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out.\n\u2022\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.  \n\u2022\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets.\n\u2022\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.\n\u2022\tUnderstand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

It start in its first module by introducing the key macroeconomic variables and explaining how they are defined and measured in order to enable the students to interpret macroeconomic data properly.\n\nIn the second module, the course offers a perspective for separating out various parts of the economy driven by different processes and for combining those components to develop a richer view of the whole. In particular, it applies this approach to the analysis of the relationship of the trade deficit with the budget deficit and private savings, offering insights about some key determinants of the balance of payments.\n\nThe third and fourth modules focus on the analyses of the foreign currency and money markets to provide fundamental models of the interest rate and exchange rate determination. They also discuss how these variables interact with each other and with the macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy and the expectations about the future trends in the economy. These analyses lay the foundation for more comprehensive models of the macroeconomy in the next course of the Managerial Economics and Business Analysis Specialization.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tSystematically assess the national and international economic environment in which you live and work.\n\u2022\tAnalyze macroeconomic issues using key tools.\n\u2022\tBe a more effective professional in your line of activity.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

The first module develops a model of macroeconomy in the short run when the price level has its own momentum and does not respond much to supply and demand forces. The model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the foreign exchange market. It then connects the long-run outcome with expectations about the future trends in the exchange rate at each moment, which constitute a key driver of the spot exchange rate in the short run. The methodology developed for this purpose can be applied to expectations concerning other macroeconomic variables as well. Finally, the long-run foreign exchange model is employed to derive a number of important lessons for the long run trends in currency values and competitiveness of producers in various countries.\n\nThe third module examines the drivers of aggregate output in the long run and the mechanisms of adjustment from the short run to the long run. The model provides insights about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them. It connects these deviations to country characteristics that one needs to take into account when assessing a country\u2019s long-term macroeconomic environment. The module ends with a discussion of the institutional conditions that help bring about better fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tUnderstand how the market for aggregate goods and services interacts with the money market to shape the macroeconomic equilibrium that determines income, interest rate, and exchange rate in the short run.\n\u2022\tUnderstand the links between the short-run and long-run processes.\n\u2022\tAssess the dynamic effects of macroeconomic policies and understand the roles of globalization, government policies, institutions, and expectations in macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

We identify conditions for selecting the optimal amount of debt for a corporation looking to maximize its value.  You\u2019ll become fluent in related concepts like norms and benchmarks. You will explore these and other factors that influence debt for individuals and for public sector organizations -including governments, who are the largest consumers of debt. Like pollution, debt creates systemic risks even for the people and organizations that don\u2019t create it. This course discusses the imperative of limiting and reducing debt and the costs to all of us if we don\u2019t. We build on case based learning giving you opportunities  to interpret, uncover and acquire financial information that is often hidden or missing. We also summarize important threads from previous courses to give you a deep and cohesive understanding of when debt works for you and when it becomes your worst enemy.", "Each course in F4E offers key insights and knowledge you will be able to apply in real-life situations. You\u2019ll test drive those insights through activities and assessments that will influence your key money Decisions, your participation in financial Markets, your experience in preserving or creating Value, and in managing Debt.

It is designed to help participants develop skills to analyze policy proposals and advocate for their preferred options for issues on the public policy agenda ahead. The class assumes basic knowledge about governing institutions and democratic processes, while recommending supplemental materials for further study to complement reading links provided. The course focuses on future policy challenges, while examining the broad historical context in which policies are adopted and implemented.\n\nAs the course evaluates how issues are advanced by private sector interests, non-governmental organizations, and government policymakers, it examines how groups become effective policy advocates. Particular attention is paid to how winning coalitions are formed and how issue framing shapes the outcome of policy campaigns. The goal is neither to produce partisan talking points, nor to favor one governance philosophy over others. Rather it is to clarify the public policy challenges ahead and to enhance participants\u2019 understanding of how policy options are adopted in the real world arena of contemporary politics.\n\nComing soon, you will be able to join Signature Track, a system that verifies your identity when you take an exam.

To this end, we discuss a variety of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the regulation of speech and religion, and difficulties raised by the emerging threat of global environmental decay."]},

In Modules 3 & 4 we survey the essential elements of post-photography image management, using Adobe(tm) LIGHTROOM(tm).  Image adjustment software designed for Smartphone photographers rounds out the Course.

Next you will learn principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light in Ambient/Natural settings.  \n\nThe flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in to your camera or an add-on \"hotshoe\" model, will finally be something you, not the camera, controls!  You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious, as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.  \n\nThere is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.

The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also yours to discover.

{"title": "Data Science at Scale Specialization", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science", "text": ["Data analysis has replaced data acquisition as the bottleneck to evidence-based decision making --- we are drowning in it.  Extracting knowledge from large, heterogeneous, and noisy datasets requires not only powerful computing resources, but the programming abstractions to use them effectively.  The abstractions that emerged in the last decade blend ideas from parallel databases, distributed systems, and programming languages to create a new class of scalable data analytics platforms that form the foundation for data science at realistic scales.\n\nIn this course, you will learn the landscape of relevant systems, the principles on which they rely, their tradeoffs, and how to evaluate their utility against your requirements. You will learn how practical systems were derived from the frontier of research in computer science and what systems are coming on the horizon.   Cloud computing, SQL and NoSQL databases, MapReduce and the ecosystem it spawned, Spark and its contemporaries, and specialized systems for graphs and arrays will be covered.\n\nYou will also learn the history and context of data science, the skills, challenges, and methodologies the term implies, and how to structure a data science project.  At the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nLearning Goals: \n1. Describe common patterns, challenges, and approaches associated with data science projects, and what makes them different from projects in related fields.\n2. Identify and use the programming models associated with scalable data manipulation, including relational algebra, mapreduce, and other data flow models.\n3. Use database technology adapted for large-scale analytics, including the concepts driving parallel databases, parallel query processing, and in-database analytics\n4. Evaluate key-value stores and NoSQL systems, describe their tradeoffs with comparable systems, the details of important examples in the space, and future trends.\n5. \u201cThink\u201d in MapReduce to effectively write algorithms for systems including Hadoop and Spark.  You will understand their limitations, design details, their relationship to databases, and their associated ecosystem of algorithms, extensions, and languages.\nwrite programs in Spark\n6. Describe the landscape of specialized Big Data systems for graphs, arrays, and streams", "Statistical experiment design and analytics are at the heart of data science.  In this course you will design statistical experiments and analyze the results using modern methods.  You will also explore the common pitfalls in interpreting statistical arguments, especially those associated with big data.  Collectively, this course will help you internalize a core set of practical and effective machine learning methods and concepts, and apply them to solve some real world problems.\n\n  \nLearning Goals: After completing this course, you will be able to:\n1. Design effective experiments and analyze the results\n2. Use resampling methods to make clear and bulletproof statistical arguments without invoking esoteric notation\n3. Explain and apply a core set of classification methods of increasing complexity (rules, trees, random forests), and associated optimization methods (gradient descent and variants)\n4. Explain and apply a set of unsupervised learning concepts and methods\n5. Describe the common idioms of large-scale graph analytics, including structural query, traversals and recursive queries, PageRank, and community detection", "Important note: The second assignment in this course covers the topic of Graph Analysis in the Cloud, in which you will use Elastic MapReduce and the Pig language to perform graph analysis over a moderately large dataset, about 600GB. In order to complete this assignment, you will need to make use of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon has generously offered to provide up to $50 in free AWS credit to each learner in this course to allow you to complete the assignment. Further details regarding the process of receiving this credit are available in the welcome message for the course, as well as in the assignment itself. Please note that Amazon, University of Washington, and Coursera cannot reimburse you for any charges if you exhaust your credit.\n\nWhile we believe that this assignment contributes an excellent learning experience in this course, we understand that some learners may be unable or unwilling to use AWS. We are unable to issue Course Certificates for learners who do not complete the assignment that requires use of AWS. As such, you should not pay for a Course Certificate in Communicating Data Results if you are unable or unwilling to use AWS, as you will not be able to successfully complete the course without doing so.\n\nMaking predictions is not enough!  Effective data scientists know how to explain and interpret their results, and communicate findings accurately to stakeholders to inform business decisions.  Visualization is the field of research in computer science that studies effective communication of quantitative results by linking perception, cognition, and algorithms to exploit the enormous bandwidth of the human visual cortex.  In this course you will learn to recognize, design, and use effective visualizations.\n\nJust because you can make a prediction and convince others to act on it doesn\u2019t mean you should.  In this course you will explore the ethical considerations around big data and how these considerations are beginning to influence policy and practice.   You will learn the foundational limitations of using technology to protect privacy and the codes of conduct emerging to guide the behavior of data scientists.  You will also learn the importance of reproducibility in data science and how the commercial cloud can help support reproducible research even for experiments involving massive datasets, complex computational infrastructures, or both.\n\nLearning Goals: After completing this course, you will be able to:\n1. Design and critique visualizations\n2. Explain the state-of-the-art in privacy, ethics, governance around big data and data science\n3. Use cloud computing to analyze large datasets in a reproducible way.", "In the capstone, students will engage on a real world project requiring them to apply skills from the entire data science pipeline: preparing, organizing, and transforming data, constructing a model, and evaluating results.    Through a collaboration with Coursolve, each Capstone project is associated with partner stakeholders who have a vested interest in your results and are eager to deploy them in practice.  These projects will not be straightforward and the outcome is not prescribed -- you will need to tolerate ambiguity and negative results!  But we believe the experience will be rewarding and will better prepare you for data science projects in practice.", "More questions? Visit the ", ".", "Learn scalable data management, evaluate big data technologies, and design effective visualizations.\n\nThis Specialization covers intermediate topics in data science. You will gain hands-on experience with scalable SQL and NoSQL data management solutions, data mining algorithms, and practical statistical and machine learning concepts. You will also learn to visualize data and communicate results, and you\u2019ll explore legal and ethical issues that arise in working with big data.

Prepare for the all important \"Tell Me About Yourself\" question.\n\n4.     Prepare for traditional interview questions.\n\n5.     Use strategies for handling the salary question.  We don't teach you salary negotiation techniques, but we do teach you  how to avoid putting yourself in a weak negotiation position.\n\n6.\tPrepare an elevator speech - all three variations.\n\n7.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to present professional accomplishments and qualifications in a manner that conveys benefits to a potential employer.\n\n8.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to convince a potential employer of your interest, motivation and preparation for a particular position.\n\n9.\tAdapt your nonverbal communication style to the expectations of English-speaking interviewers."]},

No other attribute, personality, inherent entrepreneurial proclivities, training, or demographic profile is common to all successful entrepreneurs whether Warren Buffet, Steve Jobs, or the neighborhood florist or grocer.\n\nThe course provides learners with an understanding of the attributes and perspectives of an entrepreneurial mindset, and the process to acquire one. The course introduces concepts that enables a person to start a transformative process in the way they think generally, and in the way they think about business specifically. This new way of thinking has the potential to positively impact not only them, but their family, and community.", "Where do great business ideas come from? We all have compelling business concepts that we've been thinking about for years. In this course we will explore how to use observational tools and other techniques for idea generation and we will talk about how to evaluate the good ideas from the bad. The goal is to settle on a business idea that you are not only passionate about but also has real market application.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -build a resource inventory from which they can assess and create market opportunities;\n   -pursue market opportunities consistent with personal passions and capabilities; and\n   -triage potential ideas in terms of which have the greatest potential for commercial and personal success.", "According to Steven Blank a business startup, or any new venture startup is essentially a proto-type. Thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process to refine that business proto-type into a scalable, replicable finished 'product'.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -complete a business model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and how they will make \n    money.\n   - systematically test and validate these assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and\n   - use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are based on actual resources and efforts expended.\n\nThe days of the 40 page business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.\n\nThe planning here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.", "Just like when building a house the foundation for your business provides the framework for success. A business built on weak structure will struggle to succeed. We'll address some of the most pressing issues that you as a business owner must face while constructing the proper framework for your business. \n\nSpecifically at the end of this course you will be able to:\n   - create and evaluate your company's financial documents;\n   -complete the documents and regulatory procedures to create a legal business entity;\n   - protect your intellectual property;\n   -develop a management team;", "This course is the last course in this specialization before its capstone experience where you, the learner will launch your business. Consider all the activities associated with the final preparation for a NASA launch before the final countdown takes place. Those are the type of activities with respect to launching a business that will be covered in this course. The goal of the course is for you to have a document that details all the actions you need to take, and all the things that you need to think about before launching your business, with instructions on how to do those actions and how to thing about those things. \n\nSpecifically the course will provide you with five benefits or outcomes. First your attitude will be finely focused and tuned to the mindset concepts covered in course one that are likely to have the greatest impact on your business launch. Second in a similar fashion you will become keenly aware of those aspects of your business that directly impact its ability to create and deliver value on day one; and have actions plans to address each aspect. With your 'mind right' and your 'business right' the third and fourth outcomes of the course are actions plans to get your 'market connections' right. The course will allow you to explore strategies and tactics to engage the market, communication your message, and generate sales; and select those which give you the best opportunity to learn and establish a foundation for growth. Finally the course will walk you through a final checklist of operational issues that will allow you to enter the capstone course and your business launch ready to go on day one.\n\nThroughout the course we have emphasized the importance of market engagement, allowing the market to provide feedback that sharpens your business and maximizes its chances for success. As with the entire specialization the feedback you will get through the peer review assignments for this course and the capstone course are an invaluable opportunity for for such engagement.", "It is a clich\u00e9, but nevertheless very true. Experience is the best teacher. It is also the best confidence builder. It is time for you to take action! The concepts and skills presented throughout the courses in the specialization are applied in this capstone course where you will launch an actual business.\n\nIt will not be a business concept described on paper, but a functional business with legal status in your particular governmental jurisdiction, developed within your available resources whatever they are, and challenged to generate revenue.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of this specialization is the business development environment provided by the population of learners. At the point of the capstone course your thousands of fellow learners become consultants capable of refining and adding value to your business concept, they may also be potential customers or at the very least allow you to observe the likely reactions from potential customers.\n\nWith the experience of launching this startup, and the execution capabilities and confidence gain from that experience it is our desire that you repeat the process and launch another startup or a bigger version of this startup. Hopefully going on to launch another, and another, and another, evoking another clich\u00e9, 'practice will make perfect'.", "More questions?

We will cover a progression of topics necessary for successful business creation including: mindset, ideation, planning, action and strategy. Rather than just describing what to do, the focus will be on guiding you through the process of actualy doing it. The Capstone course will bring all of the tools and lessons discussed together for you to launch your business. It may not be the business of your dreams, but it will be a functional business giving you the execution capability to start something you are passionate about."]},

We will use examples from sociology, political sciences, educational sciences, communication sciences and psychology.", "In this course you will be introduced to the basic ideas behind the qualitative research in social science. You will learn about data collection, description, analysis and interpretation in qualitative research. Qualitative research often involves an iterative process. We will focus on the ingredients required for this process: data collection and analysis.\nYou won't learn how to use qualitative methods by just watching video's, so we put much stress on collecting data through observation and interviewing and on analysing and interpreting the collected data in other assignments.\nObviously, the most important concepts in qualitative research will be discussed, just as we will discuss quality criteria, good practices, ethics, writing some methods of analysis, and mixing methods.\nWe hope to take away some prejudice, and enthuse many students for qualitative research.", "Understanding statistics is essential to understand research in the social and behavioral sciences. In this course you will learn the basics of statistics; not just how to calculate them, but also how to evaluate them. This course will also prepare you for the next course in the specialization - the course Inferential Statistics. \n\nIn the first part of the course we will discuss methods of descriptive statistics. You will learn what cases and variables are and how you can compute measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and dispersion (standard deviation and variance). Next, we discuss how to assess relationships between variables, and we introduce the concepts correlation and regression. \n\nThe second part of the course is concerned with the basics of probability: calculating probabilities, probability distributions and sampling distributions. You need to know about these things in order to understand how inferential statistics work. \n\nThe third part of the course consists of an introduction to methods of inferential statistics - methods that help us decide whether the patterns we see in our data are strong enough to draw conclusions about the underlying population we are interested in. We will discuss confidence intervals and significance tests.\n\nYou will not only learn about all these statistical concepts, you will also be trained to calculate and generate these statistics yourself using freely available statistical software.", "Inferential statistics are concerned with making inferences based on relations found in the sample, to relations in the population. Inferential statistics help us decide, for example, whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population.\n\nWe will start by considering the basic principles of significance testing: the sampling and test statistic distribution, p-value, significance level, power and type I and type II errors. Then we will consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs. For each individual statistical test we will consider how it works, for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted. You will also learn how to perform these tests using freely available software. \n\nFor those who are already familiar with statistical testing: We will look at z-tests for 1 and 2 proportions,  McNemar's test for dependent proportions, t-tests for 1 mean (paired differences) and 2 means, the Chi-square test for independence, Fisher\u2019s exact test, simple regression (linear and exponential) and multiple regression (linear and logistic), one way and factorial analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, sign test,  signed-rank test, runs test).", "The Final Research Project consists of a research study that you will perform in collaboration with fellow learners. Together you will formulate a research hypothesis and design, come up with operationalizations, create manipulation and measurement instruments, collect data, perform statistical analyses and document the results. \n\nIn this course you will go through the entire research process and will be able to help determine what research question we will investigate and how we design and perform the research. This is an invaluable experience if you want to be able to critically evaluate scientific research in the social and behavioral sciences or design and perform your own studies in the future.", "More questions?

We will explain the science behind each topic in a simple, non-technical way, while also addressing the philosophical and conceptual questions arising from it. Areas you\u2019ll learn about will include:\n\n          Philosophy of psychology, among whose issues we will cover the evolution of the human mind and the nature of consciousness.\n\n           Philosophy of neurosciences, where we\u2019ll consider the nature of human cognition and the relation between mind, machines, and the environment.\n\n\n Learning objectives\n\nGain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences\n\nUnderstand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the cognitive sciences.\n\nDevelop critical skills to evaluate and assess these problems.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\nTo accompany 'Philosophy and the Sciences', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy and the Sciences for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Philosophy and the Sciences' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy and the Sciences team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind. 'Philosophy and the Sciences for Everyone' contains clear and user-friendly chapters, chapter summaries, glossary, study questions, suggestions for further reading and guides to online resources.\n\nPlease note, this companion book is optional - all the resources needed to complete the course are available freely and listed on the course site."]},

It examines a range of dynamic interactions in the unfolding of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities. It investigates ways in which we understand evolutionary processes and the implications for humans and our ecological future.  \n\nThe Journey course, thus, is based on a new integration that is emerging from the dialogue of the sciences and humanities. Journey tells the story of evolution as an epic narrative, rather than as a series of facts separated by scientific disciplines. This changes our perception so that we begin to see ourselves as an integral part of this narrative. By situating ourselves within this story we can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of processes such as self-organizing dynamics, natural selection, emergence, symbiosis, and co-evolution.

It draws on his books, articles, and recorded lectures to examine such ideas as: the New Story, the Great Work, and the emerging Ecozoic era.  The course explores Berry\u2019s insights into cosmology as a context for locating the human in a dynamic unfolding universe and thus participating in the creative work of our times. In particular, we will examine Berry\u2019s reflections on renewal and reform in the areas of ecology, economics, education, spirituality, and the arts.\n\n\t\nCourse Rationale:\n\n\tThomas Berry was an original, creative, and comprehensive thinker, especially regarding the critical nature of our global environmental crisis.  His intellectual importance resides in his response to the ecological crisis by bringing together the humanities and science in an evolutionary narrative.  In addition, he articulated the need for the moral participation of the world religions in addressing environmental issues.  He came to this realization largely through his study of cosmologies embedded within religious traditions.  Sensing the significance of these stories as \u201cfunctional cosmologies\u201d he explored the widespread influence that these stories transmitted through a tradition, for example, in rituals, ethics, and subsistence practices.\n\nUpcoming sessions\nMay 8, 2017 - June 26, 2017\nJune 5, 2017 - July 24, 2017\nJuly 3, 2017 - August 21, 2017\nJuly 31, 2017 - September 18, 2017\nAugust 28, 2017 - October 16, 2017\nSeptember 25, 2017 - November 13, 2017", "The ecological and social challenges we are facing as a human species are multiple, complex, and vexing.

Finally, the feedback loop is modeled, analyzed, and designed to meet requirements such as output regulation, bandwidth and transient response, and rejection of disturbances.\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to design and analyze the feedback systems of switching regulators.\n\nThis course assumes prior completion of courses Introduction to Power Electronics and Converter Circuits."]},

At the end of the first course you will have studied how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images.  Through hands-on practice with these use cases, you will be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.\n\nThis first course treats the machine learning method as a black box.  Using this abstraction, you will focus on understanding tasks of interest, matching these tasks to machine learning tools, and assessing the quality of the output. In subsequent courses, you will delve into the components of this black box by examining models and algorithms.  Together, these pieces form the machine learning pipeline, which you will use in developing intelligent applications.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  \n   -Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.\n   -Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  \n   -Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.\n   -Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. \n   -Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.\n   -Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.\n   -Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  \n   -Implement these techniques in Python.", "Case Study - Predicting Housing Prices\n\nIn our first case study, predicting house prices, you will create models that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).  This is just one of the many places where regression can be applied.  Other applications range from predicting health outcomes in medicine, stock prices in finance, and power usage in high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression.\n\nIn this course, you will explore regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection.  You will be able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity.  You will also analyze the impact of aspects of your data -- such as outliers -- on your selected models and predictions.  To fit these models, you will implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Describe the input and output of a regression model.\n   -Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.\n   -Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.\n   -Tune parameters with cross validation.\n   -Analyze the performance of the model.\n   -Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.\n   -Deploy methods to select between models.\n   -Exploit the model to form predictions. \n   -Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python.", "Case Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction\n\nIn our case study on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).

These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification. \n\nIn this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We've also included optional content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper! \n\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.\n   -Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.\n   -Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.  \n   -Create a non-linear model using decision trees.\n   -Improve the performance of any model using boosting.\n   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.\n   -Describe the underlying decision boundaries.  \n   -Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  \n   -Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.\n   -Use techniques for handling missing data.\n   -Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).", "Case Studies: Finding Similar Documents\n\nA reader is interested in a specific news article and you want to find similar articles to recommend.

Perhaps you even started down that path in a language like Java or C#, when you realized that there was so much \u201cclimbing the mountain\u201d that you had to do? Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going.\n \nIn this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the \u201ccloud\u201d using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortless\u2026 Really!\n \n\u201cBut wait\u201d, you will say, \u201cthere is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved.

But what if\u2026 instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? \u201cOk, but that\u2019s probably very complicated\u201d, you will say. Take this course and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how easy it is!", "You already know how to build a basic web application with the Ruby on Rails framework. Perhaps, you have even taken Course 1, \"Ruby on Rails: An Introduction\" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your \u201cdata layer\u201d. But in the back of your mind, you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.\n \nIn Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data. Take this course to build a Ruby on Rails application with Active Record to automate the detailed SQL interactions with our database.", "In this course, we will explore MongoDB, a very popular NoSQL database and Web Services concepts and integrate them both with Ruby on Rails.

The modules will go in-depth from installation to CRUD operations, aggregation, indexing, GridFS and various other topics where we continuously integrate MongoDB with RailsRuby.  We will be covering the interface to MongoDB using the Mongo Ruby API and the Mongoid ORM framework (the MongoDB access counterpart to RDBMS/ActiveRecord within Rails).  The last portion of the course will focus on Web Services with emphasis on REST, its architectural style and integration of Web Services with Rails.

The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.\n\nThe second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information, and confidence intervals for linear regression.\n\nAll the data you need is provided within the course, all assignments are designed to be done in MS Excel, and you will learn enough Excel to complete all assignments. The course will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions, and you\u2019ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality you might need in the future (module 1).\n\nThe course does not cover Visual Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments. All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions. You will emerge with substantial vocabulary and practical knowledge of how to apply business data analysis methods based on binary classification (module 2), information theory and entropy measures (module 3), and linear regression (module 4 and 5), all using no software tools more complex than Excel.", "One of the skills that characterizes great business data analysts is the ability to communicate practical implications of quantitative analyses to any kind of audience member.  Even the most sophisticated statistical analyses are not useful to a business if they do not lead to actionable advice, or if the answers to those business questions are not conveyed in a way that non-technical people can understand.  \n\nIn this course you will learn how to become a master at communicating business-relevant implications of data analyses.  By the end, you will know how to structure your data analysis projects to ensure the fruits of your hard labor yield results for your stakeholders.  You will also know how to streamline your analyses and highlight their implications efficiently using visualizations in Tableau, the most popular visualization program in the business world.  Using other Tableau features, you will be able to make effective visualizations that harness the human brain\u2019s innate perceptual and cognitive tendencies to convey conclusions directly and clearly.  Finally, you will be practiced in designing and persuasively presenting business \u201cdata stories\u201d that use these visualizations, capitalizing on business-tested methods and design principles.", "This course is an introduction to how to use relational databases in business analysis.  You will learn how relational databases work, and how to use entity-relationship diagrams to display the structure of the data held within them.  This knowledge will help you understand how data needs to be collected in business contexts, and help you identify features you want to consider if you are involved in implementing new data collection efforts.  You will also learn how to execute the most useful query and table aggregation statements for business analysts, and practice using them with real databases. No more waiting 48 hours for someone else in the company to provide data to you \u2013 you will be able to get the data by yourself!\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of how relational databases work, and have a portfolio of queries you can show potential employers. Businesses are collecting increasing amounts of information with the hope that data will yield novel insights into how to improve businesses. Analysts that understand how to access this data \u2013 this means you! \u2013 will have a strong competitive advantage in this data-smitten business world.", "In this final course you will complete a Capstone Project using data analysis to recommend a method for improving profits for your company, Watershed Property Management, Inc. Watershed is responsible for managing thousands of residential rental properties throughout the United States. Your job is to persuade Watershed\u2019s management team to pursue a new strategy for managing its properties that will increase their profits. To do this, you will: (1) Elicit information about important variables relevant to your analysis; (2) Draw upon your new MySQL database skills to extract relevant data from a real estate database; (3) Implement data analysis in Excel to identify the best opportunities for Watershed to increase revenue and maximize profits, while managing any new risks; (4) Create a Tableau dashboard to show Watershed executives the results of a sensitivity analysis; and (5) Articulate a significant and innovative business process change for Watershed based on your data analysis, that you will recommend to company executives. \n\nAirbnb, our Capstone\u2019s official Sponsor, provided input on the project design.

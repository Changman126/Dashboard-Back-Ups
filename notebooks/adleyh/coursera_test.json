{"title": "Data Science  Specialization", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science", "text": ["In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. The course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. There are two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge. The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio.", "In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment and describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis will provide working examples.", "Before you can work with data you have to get some. This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover obtaining data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from colleagues in various formats. It will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data \u201ctidy\u201d. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.", "This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.", "This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.", "Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, \u2026) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.", "Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions.  Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist\u2019s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.", "One of the most common tasks performed by data scientists and data analysts are prediction and machine learning. This course will cover the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications. The course will provide basic grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets, overfitting, and error rates. The course will also introduce a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course will cover the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.", "A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.", "The capstone project class will allow students to create a usable/public data product that can be used to show your skills to potential employers.

It starts a \u201cconversation\u201d with users and stakeholders inside and outside an organization.  Conversations are the natural way people think about complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop \u201cstories,\u201d which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises \u2013 in all departments and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks. \n\nIn this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier \u2013 creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their enterprise stand out. \n\nRegardless of their area of work, position or expertise, Content Strategy practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable, actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic content they produce enhances the user\u2019s lives and deepens their understanding and engagement with the organization.\n\nGuest lecturers in this course include:\n-- Rachel Davis Mersey, Associate Professor, Medill, Northwestern\n-- Ed Malthouse, Theodore R. and Annie Laurie Sills Professor of Integrated Marketing Communications, Medill, Northwestern\n-- Bobby Calder, Charles H. Kellstadt Professor of Marketing & Director of the Center for Cultural Marketing, Kellogg, Northwestern\n-- Steven Duke, Associate Professor, Medill, Northwestern\n-- Janice Castro, Assistant Professor Emerita, Medill, Nothwestern", "In the second course of the Content Strategy Specialization - \"Managing Content\" - you will dive deeper into Content Strategy by learning some great options for managing your important content once it's been created. You will look at media platforms and how best to tell an organization\u2019s \u201ccontent story\u201d across those platforms using a human-centered design. Then, you'll take a close look at ways to best utilize social and mobile media, as well as some of the issues around insourcing/outsourcing content. Finally, you'll get an inside look at how legal issues associated with Content Strategy are handled in companies large and small around the globe.\n\nThis course serves professionals who want to learn to manage their trustable, engaging and often interactive content to advance their enterprise\u2019s future and their own career in it. As a bonus, we've also included a toolkit to download and take back to work. Can\u2019t remember the 3 truths that frame all communications in the digital age? Need to convince a co-worker that a human centered design approach is best for your project? Want to review how you create an engaging brand for your content? You will find answers to those questions and more in the toolkit.\n\nGuest lecturers in this course include:\n-- Emily Withrow, Assistant Professor, Medill, Northwestern\n-- Jeremy Gilbert, Director of Strategic Initiatives, The Washington Post\n-- Randy Hlavac, Lecturer, Medill, Northwestern (and lead professor of the Social Media Marketing Specialization also on Coursera)", "In this, the third Content Strategy course, participants will learn actionable ways to grow internal and external audiences.  They will deepen their understanding about those target individuals and will use a host of known and emerging tools and social networks to meaningfully reach them. As its name makes clear, this course will expand your content's impact and reach. \n\nYou will begin by learning how to utilize content trends to jump-start your organization's influence. You'll also look at how to engage with multi-channel digital communities across all social media. Finally, you'll hear about some of the best ways to enhance your content with new interactivity tools and gamification.\n\nIn this information age, every organization depends on its employees and those it serves to understand where it is going and what advances the organization has made. Content Strategy will enable you to tell your important stories with far greater impact and to a large, more valuable audience.\n\nGuest lecturers in this course include:\n-- Randy Hlavac, Lecturer, Medill, Northwestern (and lead professor of the Social Media Marketing Specialization also on Coursera) \n-- Emily Withrow, Assistant Professor, Medill, Northwestern", "In the fourth course of the Content Strategy Specialization - Ensuring Your Content's Impact - you will look at visual communication and the ways you can be more effective with your font choices, photography, and video. You'll also dive deeper into social communities to help you understand how these communities form and what you can do to build your role within them. The last module is pivotal for Content Strategists. It will help you to understand how best to measure your content to maximize its effectiveness relative to the time you commit to it.\n\nWhile this MOOC does share the theoretical elements of Content Strategy, there is a much greater emphasis on its application. Creating trend-worthy headlines and blogs, social media plans, digital measurement templates, video and photography content are all skills you will have in your toolkit by the end of the MOOC, ready to apply at your organization. And speaking of toolkits, we have included one that you can download and take back to work which includes the practical tips from the learnings in this course as well as the previous one on Expanding Your Content's Reach.\n\nGuest lecturers in this course include:\n-- Zach Wise, Associate Professor, Medill Northwestern\n-- Rich Gordon, Professor & Director of Digital Innovation, Medill, Northwestern\n-- Randy Hlavac, Lecturer, Medill, Northwestern (and lead professor of the Social Media Marketing Specialization also on Coursera)", "The Capstone Project will let you demonstrate all that you have learned throughout the Content Strategy Specialization.

While it is not a real company, the assignment you are asked to complete is similar to the work you would do in the real-world. By the time you\u2019ve finished developing your response to this case, you will see how it directly relates to what confronts you in your own work. For the Capstone assignment, assume you have been selected to develop a Content Strategy for the section of Wish I Was There\u2019s website for the region, people and culture where you live and work.

For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.\n\nIf you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.\n\nAfter completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterday\u2019s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach.

They will hone their writing, design, and speaking skills and build a portfolio for a job search and/or professional application; 2. They will shape these skills into a unique brand identity; and, if they choose, 3. They will undertake a transformative effect in the world around them.

As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture.\n\nThrough visual examples, this course will teach you the fundamental principles of graphic design: imagemaking, typography, composition, working with color and shape... foundational skills that are common in all areas of graphic design practice. I don't just want you to watch a video of someone talking about design, I want you to MAKE design! If you want to be a designer you have to be a maker, a communicator, so this course will offer you lots of opportunities to get your hands dirty with exercises and with more practical projects.\n\nAt the end of this course you will have learned how to explore and investigate visual representation through a range of image-making techniques; have understand basic principles of working with shape, color and pattern; been exposed to the language and skills of typography; and understand and have applied the principles of composition and visual contrast. If you complete the course, along with its optional (but highly recommended) briefs, you will have a core set of graphic design skills that you can apply to your own projects, or to more deeply investigate a specialized area of graphic design.\n\nTo succeed in this course you will need access to a computer. You can complete this course without one but it will be tougher. Access to, and a beginner's level knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite programs, such as Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign will help you, especially if you want to complete the optional briefs.", "Typography is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control its meaning. It\u2019s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology\u2014but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.\n\nIn this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We\u2019ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We\u2019ll peek into the \u2028rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We\u2019ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we\u2019ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. \n\nInformative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating \u2028in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.\n\nPlease note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other \u2028page layout software will be assumed. You will need access to a computer and page layout software, such as InDesign, to complete the assignments.", "During this course, we\u2019ll be making exploratory images to expand your visual vocabulary. We'll create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or to try out a media. The first two weeks are experimental and exploratory; we won\u2019t be concerned with meaning or communication (although, to be honest, every image does exist in a context, and therefore communicates\u2014or can convey\u2014meaning, connotation, associations, and expressiveness). \n\nIn the second two weeks, we\u2019ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. Everyone has a natural, intuitive way of putting things together. We\u2019ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together, composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image\u2019s connotations, meanings and associations generated through elements of composition and \u201cvisual contrasts.\u201d through style, juxtaposition, closure and figures of speech. \n\nUltimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.", "This condensed survey course focuses on four key periods or themes from the history of design. Together we\u2019ll trace the emergence of design as a recognized practice, why things look the way they do, and how designers approached specific design problems in their work. \n\nEach week, a short quiz will test your knowledge of concepts, and a short reflective assignment will give you the opportunity to analyze the questions designers ask themselves today.\n\nThis is an essential course for emerging designers entering the field, or for students interested in learning more about visual culture and analysis. No previous experience is required.", "This course is the culmination of the Graphic Design Specialization and gives you an opportunity to tie together your knowledge and skills into a single project: a brand development guide for a company you will invent.\n\nThis course takes you through the entire design process, from ideation to creation to presentation. Through the guide, you will be creating and giving a visual identity to an imaginary start-up company, and applying that visual identity to a number of forms. You will also develop a logotype and accompanying graphic palette to visually represent your company, as well as apply that design to a number of different applications to see it at work.", "More questions?

We will use examples from sociology, political sciences, educational sciences, communication sciences and psychology.", "In this course you will be introduced to the basic ideas behind the qualitative research in social science. You will learn about data collection, description, analysis and interpretation in qualitative research. Qualitative research often involves an iterative process. We will focus on the ingredients required for this process: data collection and analysis.\nYou won't learn how to use qualitative methods by just watching video's, so we put much stress on collecting data through observation and interviewing and on analysing and interpreting the collected data in other assignments.\nObviously, the most important concepts in qualitative research will be discussed, just as we will discuss quality criteria, good practices, ethics, writing some methods of analysis, and mixing methods.\nWe hope to take away some prejudice, and enthuse many students for qualitative research.", "Understanding statistics is essential to understand research in the social and behavioral sciences. In this course you will learn the basics of statistics; not just how to calculate them, but also how to evaluate them. This course will also prepare you for the next course in the specialization - the course Inferential Statistics. \n\nIn the first part of the course we will discuss methods of descriptive statistics. You will learn what cases and variables are and how you can compute measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and dispersion (standard deviation and variance). Next, we discuss how to assess relationships between variables, and we introduce the concepts correlation and regression. \n\nThe second part of the course is concerned with the basics of probability: calculating probabilities, probability distributions and sampling distributions. You need to know about these things in order to understand how inferential statistics work. \n\nThe third part of the course consists of an introduction to methods of inferential statistics - methods that help us decide whether the patterns we see in our data are strong enough to draw conclusions about the underlying population we are interested in. We will discuss confidence intervals and significance tests.\n\nYou will not only learn about all these statistical concepts, you will also be trained to calculate and generate these statistics yourself using freely available statistical software.", "Inferential statistics are concerned with making inferences based on relations found in the sample, to relations in the population. Inferential statistics help us decide, for example, whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population.\n\nWe will start by considering the basic principles of significance testing: the sampling and test statistic distribution, p-value, significance level, power and type I and type II errors. Then we will consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs. For each individual statistical test we will consider how it works, for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted. You will also learn how to perform these tests using freely available software. \n\nFor those who are already familiar with statistical testing: We will look at z-tests for 1 and 2 proportions,  McNemar's test for dependent proportions, t-tests for 1 mean (paired differences) and 2 means, the Chi-square test for independence, Fisher\u2019s exact test, simple regression (linear and exponential) and multiple regression (linear and logistic), one way and factorial analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, sign test,  signed-rank test, runs test).", "The Final Research Project consists of a research study that you will perform in collaboration with fellow learners. Together you will formulate a research hypothesis and design, come up with operationalizations, create manipulation and measurement instruments, collect data, perform statistical analyses and document the results. \n\nIn this course you will go through the entire research process and will be able to help determine what research question we will investigate and how we design and perform the research.

The course draws on the Emmy-award winning film, Journey of the Universe, and the book from Yale University Press. \n\nJourney explores cosmic evolution as a creative process based on connection, interdependence, and emergence.  It examines a range of dynamic interactions in the unfolding of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities. It investigates ways in which we understand evolutionary processes and the implications for humans and our ecological future.  \n\nThe Journey course, thus, is based on a new integration that is emerging from the dialogue of the sciences and humanities. Journey tells the story of evolution as an epic narrative, rather than as a series of facts separated by scientific disciplines. This changes our perception so that we begin to see ourselves as an integral part of this narrative. By situating ourselves within this story we can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of processes such as self-organizing dynamics, natural selection, emergence, symbiosis, and co-evolution. As we discover these intricate processes of evolution, we awaken to the beauty and complexity of our natural environment at this critical juncture in our planetary history.\n\nUpcoming sessions\nMay 8, 2017 - June 26, 2017\nJune 5, 2017 - July 24, 2017\nJuly 3, 2017 - August 21, 2017\nJuly 31, 2017 - September 18, 2017\nAugust 28, 2017 - October 16, 2017\nSeptember 25, 2017 - November 13, 2017", "Journey of the Universe weaves together the discoveries of the evolutionary sciences together with humanities such as history, philosophy, art, and religion.

It draws on his books, articles, and recorded lectures to examine such ideas as: the New Story, the Great Work, and the emerging Ecozoic era.  The course explores Berry\u2019s insights into cosmology as a context for locating the human in a dynamic unfolding universe and thus participating in the creative work of our times. In particular, we will examine Berry\u2019s reflections on renewal and reform in the areas of ecology, economics, education, spirituality, and the arts.\n\n\t\nCourse Rationale:\n\n\tThomas Berry was an original, creative, and comprehensive thinker, especially regarding the critical nature of our global environmental crisis.  His intellectual importance resides in his response to the ecological crisis by bringing together the humanities and science in an evolutionary narrative.  In addition, he articulated the need for the moral participation of the world religions in addressing environmental issues.  He came to this realization largely through his study of cosmologies embedded within religious traditions.  Sensing the significance of these stories as \u201cfunctional cosmologies\u201d he explored the widespread influence that these stories transmitted through a tradition, for example, in rituals, ethics, and subsistence practices.\n\nUpcoming sessions\nMay 8, 2017 - June 26, 2017\nJune 5, 2017 - July 24, 2017\nJuly 3, 2017 - August 21, 2017\nJuly 31, 2017 - September 18, 2017\nAugust 28, 2017 - October 16, 2017\nSeptember 25, 2017 - November 13, 2017", "The ecological and social challenges we are facing as a human species are multiple, complex, and vexing.

Thomas Berry pointed a way forward with his understanding of the Great Work of our times that would help to give rise to an Ecozoic era of mutually enhancing human-Earth relations. The Great Work implies that each person has a contribution to make toward the flourishing of the Earth community.\n\nThat is the invitation of this capstone course for students to become participants in transformative learning. \nIn this capstone we offer a venue to respond to our contemporary challenges by exploring ways in which the creativity of humans can be more clearly and effectively aligned with the creativity of universe and Earth processes. This is what is intended by \u201cliving cosmology\u201d, namely how do we live within a universe story in ways that transform us? How can we dwell within a broadened consciousness of a new story of evolution? How can this empower a new context for education, art, spirituality, and ethics along with ecology, politics, economics, and business?\n\nProjects may involve the humanities or the sciences or an interdisciplinary combination. This could involve arts, literature, poetry, painting, music, or the natural and social sciences, ecological problem solving or policy-making.

With the help of various examples you will learn how to identify which data sources likely matches your research question, how to turn your research question into measurable pieces, and how to think about an analysis plan. Furthermore this course will provide you with a general framework that allows you to not only understand each step required for a successful data collection and analysis, but also help you to identify errors associated with different data sources. You will learn some metrics to quantify each potential error, and thus you will have tools at hand to describe the quality of a data source. Finally we will introduce different large scale data collection efforts done by private industry and government agencies, and review the learned concepts through these examples. This course is suitable for beginners as well as those that know about one particular data source, but not others, and are looking for a general framework to evaluate data products.", "This course presents research conducted to increase our understanding of how data collection decisions affect survey errors. This is not a \u201chow\u2013to-do-it\u201d course on data collection, but instead reviews the literature on survey design decisions and data quality in order to sensitize learners to how alternative survey designs might impact the data obtained from those surveys.\n\nThe course reviews a range of survey data collection methods that are both interview-based (face-to-face and telephone) and self-administered (paper questionnaires that are mailed and those that are implemented online, i.e. as web surveys). Mixed mode designs are also covered as well as several hybrid modes for collecting sensitive information e.g., self-administering the sensitive questions in what is otherwise a face-to-face interview. The course also covers newer methods such as mobile web and SMS (text message) interviews, and examines alternative data sources such as social media. It concentrates on the impact these techniques have on the quality of survey data, including error from measurement, nonresponse, and coverage, and assesses the tradeoffs between these error sources when researchers choose a mode or survey design.", "This course will cover the basic elements of designing and evaluating questionnaires. We will review the process of responding to questions, challenges and options for asking questions about behavioral frequencies, practical techniques for evaluating questions, mode specific questionnaire characteristics, and review methods of standardized and conversational interviewing.", "Good data collection is built on good samples.  But the samples can be chosen in many ways.  Samples can be haphazard or convenient selections of persons, or records, or networks, or other units, but one questions the quality of such samples, especially what these selection methods mean for drawing good conclusions about a population after data collection and analysis is done.  Samples can be more carefully selected based on a researcher\u2019s judgment, but one then questions whether that judgment can be biased by personal factors.  Samples can also be draw in statistically rigorous and careful ways, using random selection and control methods to provide sound representation and cost control.  It is these last kinds of samples that will be discussed in this course.  We will examine simple random sampling that can be used for sampling persons or records, cluster sampling that can be used to sample groups of persons or records or networks, stratification which can be applied to simple random and cluster samples, systematic selection, and stratified multistage samples.  The course concludes with a brief overview of how to estimate and summarize the uncertainty of randomized sampling.", "This course will cover the steps used in weighting sample surveys, including methods for adjusting for nonresponse and using data external to the survey for calibration.  Among the techniques discussed are adjustments using estimated response propensities, poststratification, raking, and general regression estimation.

Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism \u2013 rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based \u2013 the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price \u201crations\u201d the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand. \n\nAfter this course, you will be able to: \n\u2022\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve.\n\u2022\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve.\n\u2022\tExplain equilibrium in a market.\n\u2022\tExplain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium.\n\u2022\tExplain elasticity of demand.\n\u2022\tDescribe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations.\n\u2022\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out.\n\u2022\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.  \n\u2022\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets.\n\u2022\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.\n\u2022\tUnderstand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

It start in its first module by introducing the key macroeconomic variables and explaining how they are defined and measured in order to enable the students to interpret macroeconomic data properly.\n\nIn the second module, the course offers a perspective for separating out various parts of the economy driven by different processes and for combining those components to develop a richer view of the whole. In particular, it applies this approach to the analysis of the relationship of the trade deficit with the budget deficit and private savings, offering insights about some key determinants of the balance of payments.\n\nThe third and fourth modules focus on the analyses of the foreign currency and money markets to provide fundamental models of the interest rate and exchange rate determination. They also discuss how these variables interact with each other and with the macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy and the expectations about the future trends in the economy. These analyses lay the foundation for more comprehensive models of the macroeconomy in the next course of the Managerial Economics and Business Analysis Specialization.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tSystematically assess the national and international economic environment in which you live and work.\n\u2022\tAnalyze macroeconomic issues using key tools.\n\u2022\tBe a more effective professional in your line of activity.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

The first module develops a model of macroeconomy in the short run when the price level has its own momentum and does not respond much to supply and demand forces. The model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the foreign exchange market. It then connects the long-run outcome with expectations about the future trends in the exchange rate at each moment, which constitute a key driver of the spot exchange rate in the short run. The methodology developed for this purpose can be applied to expectations concerning other macroeconomic variables as well. Finally, the long-run foreign exchange model is employed to derive a number of important lessons for the long run trends in currency values and competitiveness of producers in various countries.\n\nThe third module examines the drivers of aggregate output in the long run and the mechanisms of adjustment from the short run to the long run. The model provides insights about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them. It connects these deviations to country characteristics that one needs to take into account when assessing a country\u2019s long-term macroeconomic environment. The module ends with a discussion of the institutional conditions that help bring about better fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tUnderstand how the market for aggregate goods and services interacts with the money market to shape the macroeconomic equilibrium that determines income, interest rate, and exchange rate in the short run.\n\u2022\tUnderstand the links between the short-run and long-run processes.\n\u2022\tAssess the dynamic effects of macroeconomic policies and understand the roles of globalization, government policies, institutions, and expectations in macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

You will exam the importance of using the \"right\" amount of color and in the right place and be able to apply design principles to de-clutter your data visualization.", "In this third course of the specialization, we\u2019ll drill deeper into the tools Tableau offers in the areas of charting, dates, table calculations and mapping. We\u2019ll explore the best choices for charts, based on the type of data you are using. We\u2019ll look at specific types of charts including scatter plots, Gantt charts, histograms, bullet charts and several others, and we\u2019ll address charting guidelines. We\u2019ll define discrete and continuous dates, and examine when to use each one to explain your data.  You\u2019ll learn how to create custom and quick table calculations and how to create parameters. We\u2019ll also introduce mapping and explore how Tableau can use different types of geographic data, how to connect to multiple data sources and how to create custom maps.", "Leveraging the visualizations you created in the previous course, Visual Analytics with Tableau, you will create dashboards that help you identify the story within your data, and you will discover how to use Storypoints to create a powerful story to leave a lasting impression with your audience.\n\nYou will balance the goals of your stakeholders with the needs of your end-users, and be able to structure and organize your story for maximum impact. Throughout the course you will apply more advanced functions within Tableau, such as hierarchies, actions and parameters to guide user interactions.  For your final project, you will create a compelling narrative to be delivered in a meeting, as a static report, or in an interactive display online.", "In this project-based course, you will follow your own interests to create a portfolio worthy single-frame viz or multi-frame data story that will be shared on Tableau Public. You will use all the skills taught in this Specialization to complete this project step-by-step, with guidance from your instructors along the way. You will first create a project proposal to identify your goals for the project, including the question you wish to answer or explore with data. You will then find data that will provide the information you are seeking. You will then import that data into Tableau and  prepare it for analysis. Next you will create a dashboard that will allow you to explore the data in depth and identify meaningful insights. You will then give structure to your data story by writing the story arc in narrative form. Finally, you will consult your design checklist to craft the final viz or data story in Tableau.

Your financial toolkit will include timeless concepts like compounding, discounting, annuities, effective interest rates, and more.  You will also learn how to simplify important financial calculations and apply that knowledge  to real-life decisions that can influence everything from how you pay for your car to where you live.

This course discusses the imperative of limiting and reducing debt and the costs to all of us if we don\u2019t.

That is, the value of $100 today is different from the value of $100 a year later. Then, what should be the present value of $100 that you are going to receive in 1 year? How about the value of $100 dollars that you are going to receive every year for next 10 years? How about forever? After taking this course, you are going to be able to find the present value of these types of cash flows in the future. Unlike most of finance courses, in this course, you are going to learn how to use excel to find present value of future cash flows. In addition to the present value, you are also going to learn how to find future value given investment; interest rate given investment and future cash flows, payments given interest rates, number of periods to wait given investment and interest rate, and so on.

Profitability ratios measure how profitable a firm is by looking at ROS, ROA, and ROE. Liquidity ratios measure how quickly a firm turns assets into cash to pay-off short-term liability and they include Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. Leverage ratios measure how much long-term debt a firm has relative to its assets or equity. Efficiency ratios measure how efficiently a firm utilizes its assets.

If not, then you can do this project of a public company. Therefore, the first step is selecting an actual company that you are interested in. Next, you have to do the research on and describe the firm\u2019s industry and business. Based on your research, you make an estimate of firm\u2019s growth, cash flows and earnings.

{"title": "How to Start Your Own Business Specialization", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/start-your-own-business", "text": ["This course is the first in a series on starting a business. Though new venture creation is the focus of the specialization, this course is important for everyone. It provides learners with insights to reframe their thinking in order to maximize their chances for success. Whether success is defined by the performance of their own venture, or by their performance within someone else\u2019s venture. The course is as much, if not more about fulfilling one's potential as it is about one starting a business.\n\nSo what can a learner expect to gain from this course? At the end of this course a learner:\n     - will be able to argue effectively against all of the reasons for not starting their business (or reaching some goal);\n     - will be  able to operate effectively within the new framework or model for starting a business (or any new endeavor),\n        thus increasing their chances for success; and\n     - will be able to make the initial business startup decisions of what type of business to start, and what type of business \n       owner to be.\n\nIn her classic text, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, Stanford Professor Carol S. Dweck presents her research showing that hard work and mindset impact success more than natural talent, and that people have the ability to choose which mindset they wish to operate from.\n\nDr. Alain Fayolle in the Financial Times defines an Entrepreneurial mindset as a specific state of mind which orientates human conduct towards entrepreneurial activities and outcomes. Individuals with entrepreneurial mindsets are often drawn to opportunities, innovation and new value creation. In terms outlined by Dr. Dweck this would be a specialized growth mindset as opposed to fixed mindset.\n\nHaving an entrepreneurial mindset is critical to being successful as an entrepreneur. An entrepreneurial mindset stands alone in terms of its importance. No other attribute, personality, inherent entrepreneurial proclivities, training, or demographic profile is common to all successful entrepreneurs whether Warren Buffet, Steve Jobs, or the neighborhood florist or grocer.\n\nThe course provides learners with an understanding of the attributes and perspectives of an entrepreneurial mindset, and the process to acquire one. The course introduces concepts that enables a person to start a transformative process in the way they think generally, and in the way they think about business specifically. This new way of thinking has the potential to positively impact not only them, but their family, and community.", "Where do great business ideas come from? We all have compelling business concepts that we've been thinking about for years. In this course we will explore how to use observational tools and other techniques for idea generation and we will talk about how to evaluate the good ideas from the bad. The goal is to settle on a business idea that you are not only passionate about but also has real market application.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -build a resource inventory from which they can assess and create market opportunities;\n   -pursue market opportunities consistent with personal passions and capabilities; and\n   -triage potential ideas in terms of which have the greatest potential for commercial and personal success.", "According to Steven Blank a business startup, or any new venture startup is essentially a proto-type. Thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process to refine that business proto-type into a scalable, replicable finished 'product'.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -complete a business model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and how they will make \n    money.\n   - systematically test and validate these assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and\n   - use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are based on actual resources and efforts expended.\n\nThe days of the 40 page business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.\n\nThe planning here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.", "Just like when building a house the foundation for your business provides the framework for success. A business built on weak structure will struggle to succeed. We'll address some of the most pressing issues that you as a business owner must face while constructing the proper framework for your business. \n\nSpecifically at the end of this course you will be able to:\n   - create and evaluate your company's financial documents;\n   -complete the documents and regulatory procedures to create a legal business entity;\n   - protect your intellectual property;\n   -develop a management team;", "This course is the last course in this specialization before its capstone experience where you, the learner will launch your business. Consider all the activities associated with the final preparation for a NASA launch before the final countdown takes place. Those are the type of activities with respect to launching a business that will be covered in this course. The goal of the course is for you to have a document that details all the actions you need to take, and all the things that you need to think about before launching your business, with instructions on how to do those actions and how to thing about those things. \n\nSpecifically the course will provide you with five benefits or outcomes. First your attitude will be finely focused and tuned to the mindset concepts covered in course one that are likely to have the greatest impact on your business launch. Second in a similar fashion you will become keenly aware of those aspects of your business that directly impact its ability to create and deliver value on day one; and have actions plans to address each aspect. With your 'mind right' and your 'business right' the third and fourth outcomes of the course are actions plans to get your 'market connections' right. The course will allow you to explore strategies and tactics to engage the market, communication your message, and generate sales; and select those which give you the best opportunity to learn and establish a foundation for growth. Finally the course will walk you through a final checklist of operational issues that will allow you to enter the capstone course and your business launch ready to go on day one.\n\nThroughout the course we have emphasized the importance of market engagement, allowing the market to provide feedback that sharpens your business and maximizes its chances for success. As with the entire specialization the feedback you will get through the peer review assignments for this course and the capstone course are an invaluable opportunity for for such engagement.", "It is a clich\u00e9, but nevertheless very true. Experience is the best teacher. It is also the best confidence builder. It is time for you to take action! The concepts and skills presented throughout the courses in the specialization are applied in this capstone course where you will launch an actual business.\n\nIt will not be a business concept described on paper, but a functional business with legal status in your particular governmental jurisdiction, developed within your available resources whatever they are, and challenged to generate revenue.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of this specialization is the business development environment provided by the population of learners. At the point of the capstone course your thousands of fellow learners become consultants capable of refining and adding value to your business concept, they may also be potential customers or at the very least allow you to observe the likely reactions from potential customers.\n\nWith the experience of launching this startup, and the execution capabilities and confidence gain from that experience it is our desire that you repeat the process and launch another startup or a bigger version of this startup. Hopefully going on to launch another, and another, and another, evoking another clich\u00e9, 'practice will make perfect'.", "More questions? Visit the ", "."]},

{"title": "Interviewing and Resume Writing in English Specialization", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/english-interview-resume", "text": ["This course, the first in the \"Interviewing and Resume Writing in English\" specialization, guides you to discover the interests, talents and competencies that you can use to find and do work that leverages your strengths, passions and who you are as a person, so you can start doing work that matters to you and to the world. Whether you already have a career and are looking to move forward, whether you\u2019re looking to change careers, whether you\u2019re starting out in the world of work, whether you\u2019re coming back into the world of work after some time away \u2013 this course will help you see your path more clearly and will teach you how to communicate your value to an employer in a way that he or she can immediately recognize.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to 1) use your individual cognitive, social and emotional traits, together with areas of interest, to discover how to find the future jobs that can give you the greatest satisfaction; 2) identify transferable skills of greatest value to the employers who have the jobs you\u2019re interested in; 3) apply a simple strategy for presenting your skills to an employer in an effective and convincing fashion.", "The goal of hiring managers is not just to hire people who need a job. It\u2019s to hire people who believe in their organization, its mission and the work that\u2019s involved in the job position. Every hiring manager knows: Hire people to do a job and they\u2019ll work for your money. Hire people who believe in the work and they\u2019ll work for their passion.\n\nAnd this is not a case of \u201cfake it until you make it.\u201d You have to be genuine about your belief in an organization and its mission. That means you have to have researched the industry, the company, and the position \u2013 and be able to show how your goals in life align with the company\u2019s mission. Having done so will shape the impression you convey as a candidate, the way you answer traditional questions, and the way you demonstrate that you\u2019re the right candidate for the job.\n\nThis course is the second in a five-course specialization. We recommend that courses #1, #2 and #3 be taken in sequence. Course #4 - on resume and cover letter writing - can be taken in any sequence, while course #5 is the capstone for the specialization as a whole.\n\nThis course can be thought of as \"Interviewing I\", while course #3 is \"Interviewing II.\"  Course #3 covers more advanced interview formats, including behavioral and situational interviews - along with the special case of telephone screenings.  The logic for including telephone screenings - which happen at the start of the interview process - late in this specialization on interviewing is that those screenings, while happening early in the process, involve all the skills that you'll learn from course #1 through course #3.\n\nAs for this course, it will teach you how to:\n\n1.\tDo thorough research on a company of your choice.\n\n2.     Prepare for those critical first 3-5 minutes of an interview (when many recruiters say an interview is either won or lost).\n\n3.     Prepare for the all important \"Tell Me About Yourself\" question.\n\n4.     Prepare for traditional interview questions.\n\n5.     Use strategies for handling the salary question.  We don't teach you salary negotiation techniques, but we do teach you  how to avoid putting yourself in a weak negotiation position.\n\n6.\tPrepare an elevator speech - all three variations.\n\n7.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to present professional accomplishments and qualifications in a manner that conveys benefits to a potential employer.\n\n8.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to convince a potential employer of your interest, motivation and preparation for a particular position.\n\n9.\tAdapt your nonverbal communication style to the expectations of English-speaking interviewers.", "People interviewing for jobs today often fail because they are using yesterday's strategies. Recruiting technology has become more sophisticated, and the best employers are constantly changing the way interviews are done. This course gives you detailed strategies for handling tough competency-based, or behavioral,  interviews so that you can communicate the knowledge, skills, and abilities that you have and that employers demand.\n\nYou will be able to:\n\n1.  Identify what the hiring organization is looking for in using behavioral interviewing techniques.\n\n2.  List the steps in the S.T.A.R. response strategy and apply the steps, using reasonably correct language, to respond to  behavioral interview questions.\n\n3.  Use your responses to behavioral and competency-based questions to communicate your personal values.\n\n4.  Identify what the hiring organization is looking for in asking situational and wild-card interview questions.\n\n5.  List the steps in the P.R.E.P. and 5 W's response strategies and apply the steps, using reasonably correct language, to answer at least one wild-card and two situational interview questions.\n\n6.  Develop an optimal strategy for responding to the weaknesses question, based on recognizing why a hiring organization asks these questions.\n\n7.  Demonstrate your personal strengths and maturity through your responses to the weaknesses question.\n\n8.  Correctly apply hedging language to soften a negative and boosting language to emphasize a positive aspect of your professional and/or academic background.\n\n9.  Ask questions to determine how well an organization fits with your personality, career goals and salary objectives.\n\n10. Ask questions that communicate your competencies and strengths.\n\n11.  Negotiate the best job offer and compensation package for yourself.\n\n12.  Perform successfully on telephone interviews.", "How can you bring your resume to the top of the pile?  How can you present yourself to prospective employers using the language they already speak inside their organization? This course will give you answers to those questions.  You will learn how to convert a boring resume into a dynamic asset statement that conveys your talents in the language that an employer understands.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n\n1.  Identify the real purpose of a resume.\n\n2.  Identify relevant competencies for a position.\n\n3.  Adapt your resumes to Applicant Tracking Systems (resume screening software).\n\n4.  Write powerful and convincing accomplishment statements using your accomplishments inventory to strategically assemble the most relevant evidence of competency for a specific position.\n\n5.  Use the resume skills tier method to strengthen your resume.\n\n6.  Write summary sections and objective statements aligned to a job position.\n\n7.  Take advantage of web resources to find power language for your resume.\n\n8.  Produce a strong resume in a format  that is suitable both to your background and the position you're interested in.\n\n9.  Produce strong cover letters that use A.I.D.A. to help you achieve your career goals.\n\n10. Produce effective follow-up letters that help you stand out from the competition.", "In the capstone project, you will combine the skills you\u2019ve learned in the prior four courses of the specialization to polish your elevator speeches, complete your resumes - including multiple versions for different targets - complete your story file, identify possible jobs or careers, perform the research you have learned to do, write suitable cover letters, and ideally land a job!\n\nYou will:\n\n1.  Develop a personal marketing plan and campaign for getting interviews.\n\n2.  Identify at least three organizations with open positions for which you want to apply.\n\n3.  Research those organizations and positions.\n\n4.  Prepare pitch sheets and J.I.S.T. cards (mini-resumes) targeting those positions.\n\n5.  Complete your resume, and if necessary complete multiple versions to target each position.\n\n6.  Write appropriate cover letters for the positions.\n\n7.  Record and evaluate responses to a set of standard interview questions.\n\n8.  Record and evaluate responses to a set of predictable behavioral interview questions.\n\n9.  Record and evaluate a response to one situational interview question.\n\n10.  Record and evaluate a response to one wild-card question.\n\nAs the specialization has focused throughout on the real-world skills you need to research yourself, the market, and a company and has given you strategies and tools to prepare for and succeed in an interview, the capstone project should align with what you have been trained for and position you to land the job you want!", "More questions?

In these first 4 Modules you will gain the knowledge and the confidence that will help you make good choices as you consider qualities of the camera you own, and the qualities of the other types of digital cameras you might be considering. You will learn about the basic functions that most digital cameras have in common.  You will also go beyond the \"technical\" matters and learn about how you can make exciting pictures by emphasizing the aspects of Frame and Vantage Point to interpret old subjects in new ways.  Discovering accessories that photographers find useful, and the types of camera bags from mini to carry-on sized, is also in store for you.  You will also make your first photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, upload pictures to the web gallery and start interacting with your fellow learners in our \"Gallery.\"  Let's get started with Module One!", "Welcome to Course Two of Photography Basics and Beyond: From Smartphone to DSLR!  Now that you have a broad understanding of the various types of cameras, the importance of setting up Menus and Functions to gain control in your photography, and the difference between Auto and Program exposure modes, you are ready to move into even greater Camera Control!  \n\nIn these 4 Modules we will concentrate on gaining the knowledge necessary to make use of Exposure Modes, Light Metering, Effects of various ISO settings, Lens options, using Shutter Speeds to convey aspects of Time in both documentary and creative ways, and exploring the controlled focus effects that Depth of Field Principles make possible.   You will also continue to make new photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, continue interacting with your fellow learners as you share photographs for Peer Review.  You will also confirm your knowledge through completion of quizzes and written responses.  Let's get started with Module One!", "Welcome to Course THREE!  In the first two Modules you will gain a more professional-level understanding of the Design Elements that artists have used throughout history to create successful compositions.  Arranging the Elements in ways that lead viewers through their compositions is an essential craft for photographers no matter whether their subject matter is pure documentary or vividly exotic personal expression.  In Modules 3 & 4 we survey the essential elements of post-photography image management, using Adobe(tm) LIGHTROOM(tm).  Image adjustment software designed for Smartphone photographers rounds out the Course.  Since even photographers whose mainstay is a high-end DSLR also must admit to Smartphone use occasionally, and photographers who only use a Smartphone will usually admit that they want to step over to a \"regular\" camera at some point, there is something for everyone here!  Let's get started with Module One!", "Welcome to Course FOUR!   In Modules 1-4 you will cover the final elements of the Specialization necessary to round out this introduction to the fundamentals of Photography, and prepare you for creating your own exciting project in the Capstone!  You have come a long way since the beginning of this journey from Smartphone Basics to DSLR and Beyond.  Just think of all the information you have absorbed and put to use in your assignments and quizzes, and the confidence you have gained that you CAN control the camera to make pictures you are proud to share.  \n\nHere in Course Four you will start by gaining knowledge related to content in photography, from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive.  Next you will learn principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light in Ambient/Natural settings.  \n\nThe flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in to your camera or an add-on \"hotshoe\" model, will finally be something you, not the camera, controls!  You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious, as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.  \n\nThere is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.  This Course is the last before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project over a 2-month period of dedicated photography.  The Peer Review photography assignments have been structured with both your advanced capabilities and dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both!  Be prepared to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments, because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!\n\nCourse Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs as well.  The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also yours to discover.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual's creative effort, well that is  important knowledge to have in preparation for the Capstone too!  Let's get started with Module One!", "The Capstone Project is your opportunity to take advantage of the knowledge you have gained through our journey in learning about photography, to develop a meaningful project of 10 well formed photographs based in your passion for artistic expression, or a subject for documentary exploration, insightful portraiture, imaging for work-related subjects, or some other aspect of photography.  We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners, and with Professors Peter Glendinning and Mark Sullivan too!  A unique feature of this Course is the individual review and responsive input you will receive directly from Peter or Mark, who will be viewing your pictures and making evaluations of all projects at the end of the Capstone.  You should plan on spending more time on this Course per week than any other in this Specialization, and much of it will be in making photographs.\n\nDuring the entire period of development, you and your fellow learners will be supporting each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress from the initial Project Plan to the final Portfolio.  At each stage, all Learners will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping each other to gauge progress and to learn about different approaches to photography and content.  By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response to the work of others, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence as well.  \n\nAlong the way there will be multiple opportunities for sharing pictures and ideas through carefully designed Peer Review.  This sharing of photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about your photos, will be an exciting learning experience that will help you grow in understanding your own photography and that of others.  Your contribution of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms that are related to techniques, design principles, and content approaches that you have learned through your success in each of the previous Modules.  \n\nA unique aspect of this Specialization is that everyone who completes the requirements  will receive, in addition to their Certificate of Specialization from Michigan State University, access to substantial discounts on equipment, accessories, and membership benefits through Industry Partners from among the premier manufacturers of photography equipment and related items:  Fracture, Gary Fong, Gyst, Lensbaby, LensPen, Lume Cube Lighting, Photo District News, PhotoVideoEdu, Think Tank Cases/Bags.  In addition, The 'top-10' peer-reviewed Capstone projects each year will be awarded the opportunity for individual reviews, with personal responses, by world renowned photographers who have been honored with the title of Canson-Infinity\u00ae Paper Ambassadors.", "More questions?

Cloud computing is an information technology revolution that has just started to impact many enterprise computing systems in major ways, and it will change the face of computing in the years to come.\n\nWe start the first week by introducing some major concepts in cloud computing, the economics foundations of it and we introduce the concept of big data. We also cover the concept of software defined architectures, and how virtualization results in cloud infrastructure and how cloud service providers organize their offerings. In week two, we cover virtualization and containers with deeper focus, including lectures on Docker, JVM and Kubernates. We finish up week two by comparing the infrastructure as a service offering by the big three: Amazon, Google and Microsoft. \nWeek three moves to higher level of cloud offering, including platform as a service, mobile backend as a service and even serverless architectures. We also talk about some of the cloud middleware technologies that are fundamental to cloud based applications such as RPC and REST, JSON and load balancing.

Perhaps you even started down that path in a language like Java or C#, when you realized that there was so much \u201cclimbing the mountain\u201d that you had to do? Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going.\n \nIn this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the \u201ccloud\u201d using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortless\u2026 Really!\n \n\u201cBut wait\u201d, you will say, \u201cthere is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved. You need the data for an application to be useful.\u201d Great point! But what if\u2026 instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? \u201cOk, but that\u2019s probably very complicated\u201d, you will say. Take this course and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how easy it is!", "You already know how to build a basic web application with the Ruby on Rails framework. Perhaps, you have even taken Course 1, \"Ruby on Rails: An Introduction\" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your \u201cdata layer\u201d. But in the back of your mind, you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.\n \nIn Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data. Take this course to build a Ruby on Rails application with Active Record to automate the detailed SQL interactions with our database.", "In this course, we will explore MongoDB, a very popular NoSQL database and Web Services concepts and integrate them both with Ruby on Rails. MongoDB is a used to handle documents with a pre-defined schema which will give the developers an ability to store, process and use data using it\u2019s rich API. The modules will go in-depth from installation to CRUD operations, aggregation, indexing, GridFS and various other topics where we continuously integrate MongoDB with RailsRuby.  We will be covering the interface to MongoDB using the Mongo Ruby API and the Mongoid ORM framework (the MongoDB access counterpart to RDBMS/ActiveRecord within Rails).  The last portion of the course will focus on Web Services with emphasis on REST, its architectural style and integration of Web Services with Rails.  Core concepts of Web Services like request/response, filters, data representation (XML/JSON), web linking and best practices will covered in depth.\n\nThis course is ideal for students and professionals who have some programming experience and a working knowledge of databases.", "Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page?

We will start from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user\u2019s screen. You\u2019ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No \u201cpinch and zoom\u201d required!

We will enhance the functionality of our web app by utilizing dependency injection to reuse existing services as well as write our own. We will create reusable HTML components that take advantage of AngularJS data binding as well as extend HTML syntax with a very powerful feature of AngularJS called directives. We\u2019ll set up routing so our SPA can have multiple views. We will also learn how to unit test our functionality.

You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense will be a driver for you and your surrounding.\n\nLeaders from different organizations, will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience and competitive.", "Welcome to the capstone project course in the Coursera Inspirational Leadership Specialization! \nIn the next 6 weeks you'll apply the skills you learned in the Specialization to tackle a real world leadership challenge. \n\nTo better meet your own goals of taking this Specialization, we will provide one capstone project: \n\n-Personal leadership challenge; \n\nYou'll select one project to implement and will receive assessments from your Capstone peers. No matter which option you choose, the capstone project will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader. A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project, designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon\u2026) you have for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhatever personal challenge you choose, specific questions will attest to your capacity to analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by by yourself.\n\nThe process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational circuit model developed in MOOC2 \u201cGiving Sense to your Leadership Experience\u201d and MOOC3 \u201cLeading Organizations\u201d with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase, the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different scenarios for the projected outcomes. Finally, with a view to build sense out of the challenge you will come up with recommendations arguing for a preferred scenario.", "More questions? Visit the ", "."]},
